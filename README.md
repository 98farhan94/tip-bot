# Discord Tip Bot for BTC RPCs

A BTC tip bot made for Discord with MariaDB/MySQL, based off the modular (and unsecure) ERC20 Tip Bot [here](https://github.com/kayabaNerve/erc20-tip-bot-old-unsafe). This one isn't modular, yet it would be easy to modify this bot to work off ERC20s or other database systems.

To install the dependencies, run `npm i`.

Configuration variables to edit to make are at the top of each file. Please go through each one.

This is not expected to actually use BTC, as one tenth of a BTC is 1100 USD. It is meant to be used with altcoins worth less than ten dollars.

It can be modified to hundredths instead of tenths easily.

You must also edit the string data to the correct coin symbol. I do plan on making this a config variable, but have yet to.

Guides to setup MariaDB/Discord/the BTC Wallet coming soon.
